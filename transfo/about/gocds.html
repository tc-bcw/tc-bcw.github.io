    <p>Transport Canada is committed to providing Canadian citizens, organizations and stakeholders with digital services that are easy to use and trustworthy</p>
    <p>The Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat has released <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/government/publicservice/modernizing/government-canada-digital-standards.html">Digital Standards</a> to serve as the foundation for how we use technology to better manage information and deliver the quality digital services Canadians expect.</p>
    <p>The Digital Standards form the foundation of the government’s shift to becoming more agile, open, and user-focused. Even beyond digital, they will guide teams in designing services in a way that best serves Canadians. </p>

    <h2>GC Digital Standards</h2>
  </div>
  <p><strong>Design with users</strong><br>
  Research with users to understand their needs and the problems we want to solve. Conduct ongoing testing with users to guide design and development.</p>

  <p><strong>Iterate and improve frequently</strong><br>
  Develop services using agile, iterative and user-centered methods. Continuously improve in response to user needs. Try new things, start small and scale up.</p>

  <p><strong>Work in the open by default</strong><br>
  Share evidence, research and decision making openly. Make all non-sensitive data, information, and new code developed in delivery of services open to the outside world for sharing and reuse under an open licence.</p>

  <p><strong>Use open standards and solutions</strong><br>
  Leverage open standards and embrace leading practices, including the use of open source software where appropriate. Design for services and platforms that are seamless for Canadians to use no matter what device or channel they are using.</p>

  <p><strong>Address security and privacy risks</strong><br>
  Take a balanced approach to managing risk by implementing appropriate privacy and security measures. Make security measures frictionless so that they do not place a burden on users.</p>

  <p><strong>Build in accessibility from the start</strong><br>
  Services should meet or exceed accessibility standards. Users with distinct needs should be engaged from the outset to ensure what is delivered will work for everyone.</p>

  <p><strong>Empower staff to deliver better services</strong><br>
  Make sure that staff have access to the tools, training and technologies they need. Empower the team to make decisions throughout the design, build and operation of the service.</p>

  <p><strong>Be good data stewards</strong><br>
  Collect data from users only once and reuse wherever possible. Ensure that data is collected and held in a secure way so that it can easily be reused by others to provide services.</p>

  <p><strong>Design ethical services</strong><br>
  Make sure that everyone receives fair treatment. Comply with ethical guidelines in the design and use of systems which automate decision making (such as the use of artificial intelligence).</p>

  <p><strong>Collaborate widely</strong><br>
  Create multidisciplinary teams with the range of skills needed to deliver a common goal. Share and collaborate in the open. Identify and create partnerships which help deliver value to users. </p>
